# Introduction

This package implements the algorithmic tools to perform retrospective motion correction for MRI based on a reference-guided TV regularization (see `[2]`). It combines several custom packages, the most important building blocks are:
- `FastSolversForWeightedTV`: for the computation of proximal/projection operators 
- `UtilitiesForMRI`: for the computation and differentiation of the non-uniform Fourier transform with respect to rigid-body motion perturbation.
